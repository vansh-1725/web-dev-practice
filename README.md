# Web Development Practice

This repository contains my frontend practice work while learning web development.

Currently, I am focusing on:
- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox layouts

This repository will be updated gradually as I learn new topics like Bootstrap and JavaScript.

## 📁 Folder Structure

flexbox/
├── layout-1/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── screenshot.png
│
└── layout-2/
    ├── index.html
    ├── style.css
    └── screenshot.png

Each layout folder contains:
- index.html – HTML structure
- style.css – CSS styling using Flexbox
- screenshot.png – Preview of the layout output
