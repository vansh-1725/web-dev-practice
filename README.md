# Web Development Practice

This repository contains my frontend practice work.

Currently, I am learning and practicing:
- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox layouts

## Folder Structure

flexbox/
- layout-1 : Flexbox layout practice
- layout-2 : Flexbox layout practice

Each layout folder contains:
- index.html
- style.css

## Goal

To build a strong foundation in frontend development by practicing layouts step by step.

More topics like Bootstrap and JavaScript will be added later.
